# Trade Finance System - Hyperledger Fabric

A comprehensive blockchain-based trade finance system implementing Letter of Credit (LC) functionality on Hyperledger Fabric.
This enterprise-grade solution demonstrates real-world trade finance workflows with multi-organizational participation,
complex endorsement policies, and integration patterns for traditional banking systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project showcases a production-ready trade finance platform built on Hyperledger Fabric 2.3+, designed to digitize and 
streamline Letter of Credit operations across multiple financial institutions, shipping companies, and regulatory bodies.
The system eliminates paper-based processes, reduces processing time, and provides transparency across all stakeholders.

### Key Business Flows

- **LC Issuance**: Applicant requests LC, issuing bank creates and submits to advising bank
- **LC Acceptance**: Beneficiary reviews and accepts LC terms
- **Shipping**: Goods are shipped after LC acceptance provides payment guarantee
- **Document Submission**: Beneficiary submits shipping documents for verification.
- **Rest of the flow can implementated 

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Network Participants

**Banking Institutions**
- Citibank
- HSBC

**Shipping Companies**
- Maersk

**Regulatory Bodies**
- Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
- Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

### Technology Stack

**Blockchain Layer**
- Hyperledger Fabric 2.3+
- Node.js Chaincode (fabric-contract-api)
- Channel Participation API
- State-Based Endorsement Policies (SBEP)

**Backend**
- Node.js / Express.js
- RESTful API architecture
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Shared blockchain identities mapped to API user roles
- Efficient organization switching without multiple wallet identities
- Single sign-on with organization context

### 2. Smart Contract Implementation
- Comprehensive LC lifecycle management
- State-based endorsement for transaction-level policy control
- Event emission for audit trails
- Rich query support for complex data retrieval

### 3. Endorsement Policies
```javascript
// LC Creation: Requires issuing bank + advising bank
// LC Acceptance: Requires beneficiary
// Shipping: Requires shipping company
// Document Verification: Requires issuing bank + advising bank

```

### 4. Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- TLS certificate validation for peer communications
- MSP-based identity management
- Certificate Authority (CA) integration
- Role-based access control at API and chaincode levels

### 5. API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for all LC operations
- Multi-organization support
- Transaction query and history
- Document upload and verification
- Real-time status updates


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Core Banking Integration**
   - API-based middleware for traditional banking systems
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
   - SWIFT message format support

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Transaction pattern analysis
   - Risk assessment dashboards
   - Compliance reporting

3. **Extended Network**
   - Additional banking partners
   - Insurance companies
   - Freight forwarders

4. **Infrastructure Automation**
   - Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Ansible)
   - CLI orchestration tools
   - Unified configuration management

5. **Enhanced Security**
   - Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
   - Multi-signature approvals
   - Biometric authentication

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions

**Shared Identities vs Individual Identities**
- System uses shared blockchain identities per organization
- API layer maps individual users to organization identity
- Reduces wallet management complexity
- Enables efficient multi-tenant operations

**Business Logic Sequencing**
- LC acceptance occurs before shipping (provides payment guarantee)
- Document verification requires both banks
- Payment release only after successful verification chain

**Certificate Management**
- Certificates regenerate on network restart
- Connection profiles must be regenerated
- Automated scripts reduce manual intervention
